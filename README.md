# Reaper

Post-processor for Cromwell workflow outputs.

## Overview

Reaper will be a long-running web service responsible for "post-processing" the outputs of production workflows in the cloud.
It will monitor Cromwell for successful workflows, and move the outputs of each workflow it finds into long-term storage 
while recording the files in Clio. It will also parse metrics outputs and persist them to the cloud DB.

## Motivation

The idea for Reaper was born out of pain points we experienced when running post-processing-style tasks in WDL for Arrays
analysis and delivery in the cloud:

* Implicit dependencies on external systems make WDLs more complicated, more difficult to test reproducibly,
  and more dangerous to call-cache
* Injecting access credentials for Broad-internal systems into our cloud pipelines makes those pipelines harder to
  test, deploy, and share
* Transient network errors between systems cause spurious failures in Cromwell and burn operations time on
  diagnosis / resubmission

By taking ownership of tasks which require interacting with external systems, Reaper aims to enable writing cloud pipelines
which are simple to write, test, and operate.

## Getting Started

### Install Mill

http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/#installation

### Build

`mill server.compile`

### Generate Intellij .idea files

`mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea`

### Quickly run a server

`mill server`

### Run the server while watching for source changes

`mill -w server`

### Run the tests

`mill server.test`

### Format the code with scalafmt

`mill server.reformat`

## Format all the code with scalafmt

`mill mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule/reformatAll __.sources`
